The element of an array can be printed in this manner too :
instead of:
->arr[i]
            we
            can 
            use
->i[arr]

Both are correct

this is because of how it works internally

internally the elements are accessed by the use of pointers

and

they work in this manner :

if we want to access the i th element of the array, i.e arr[i] it is done like -> *(arr+i)

so, when we write i[arr]
internally it becomes -> *(i+arr)
which is same as -> *(arr+i)

don't try to add array= array+1 to increment address. However, we can use pointer= pointer + 1 to increment address
