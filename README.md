This repository contains all the code I have written while studying Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. It includes solutions to several LeetCode, Code Studio, HackerRank, and Geeks for Geeks problems. I have followed along with the DSA Busted series by Love Babbar during my DSA learning journey. Additionally, this repository also contains all the practice problems and other codes made throughout that course.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential topics in computer science and are commonly asked in technical interviews. This repository serves as my personal learning journal for DSA in C++. It contains well-organized and documented solutions to various problems from popular coding platforms like LeetCode, Code Studio, HackerRank, and Geeks for Geeks.

## DSA Busted Series

Throughout my learning journey, I followed the DSA Busted series by Love Babbar. The DSA Busted series is a comprehensive collection of DSA problem-solving tutorials and explanations, helping me build a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures. Here is the link to the **Complete C++ Placement DSA Course** from CodeHelp - by Babbar playlist that I followed : [C++ DSA](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA).


## Problem Categories

The problems in this repository are categorized based on the data structures and algorithms they cover. Some of the main categories include:

## How to Use

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ash-codes18/Cpp_DSA.git
```


2. Navigate to the relevant folder for the specific data structure or algorithm you want to explore.

3. Each problem's solution is provided in a separate C++ file

4. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp -o output
```


5. Run the executable to see the output:

```bash
./output
```


6. Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed. If you find any issues or improvements, please consider contributing (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

## Executable Files

For your convenience, I have also included [executable files](https://github.com/Ash-codes18/Cpp_DSA/tree/main/Executable%20Files) for most of the codes in this repository. If you don't want to compile the code manually, you can directly run the executables in the respective folders.
