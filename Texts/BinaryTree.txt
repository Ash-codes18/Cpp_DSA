Full BT = all nodes have either 0 children or 2 children.

Complete BT = all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

Perfect BT = all levels are completely filled.

Balanced BT = the height of the tree is O(log n) where n is the number of nodes.    

Degenerate BT = each parent node has only one associated child node.


DFS = Postorder, Inorder, Preorder
BFS = Level order
