An empty class has 1 byte of memory

A class can be defined somewhere else than the code too

By default the access modifier of a class is Private

Whenever we create any constructor, the default constructor is not created by the compiler

If an element is marked as private it can only be accessed inside the class but not outside the class

1. Padding is introduced in memory allocation to ensure proper alignment of data within structures. CPUs have specific memory alignment requirements for different types of data. When you have a structure containing different data types, the compiler might insert "padding bytes" between members to align them according to the CPU's requirements. 

2. Greedy alignment refers to the practice of arranging the members of a structure or class in such a way that padding is minimized. By placing members with larger alignment requirements before those with smaller alignment requirements, you can potentially reduce the amount of padding required.

In languages like C++, where memory layout has a significant impact on performance due to cache lines and memory access patterns, arranging members to minimize padding can lead to better memory utilization and potentially improved runtime efficiency.


4 pillars of OOP :
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Inheritance
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Abstraction

Private data member of any class cannot be inherited

Protected data member becomes Private for Private inheritance and remains Protected for Public and Protected inheritance

Public data member gets inherited the way we inherit it


5 Types of inheritance :

1. Single
2. Multi-level
3. multiple
4. hybrid
5. hierarchical
